**Hair:** Deep forest green that shifts to autumn colors (gold, red, brown) based on her emotions  
**Eyes:** Amber with flecks that look like tiny leaves

## Background Story

### Origin
Born from the collective consciousness of fallen leaves across Gensokyo's ancient forests, Shinryoku is unique among kodama. While most kodama embody a single tree, she represents the ephemeral beauty of leaves themselves - the part of trees that lives, dies, and is reborn each year.

### Past
For centuries, she existed as a whisper in the wind, a rustle in the undergrowth. She gained physical form only 200 years ago when a grieving human child, lost in the forest, cried among a pile of autumn leaves. Her tears gave Shinryoku the emotional connection needed to manifest.

### Present
Now she dwells in the Heart of Leaves, a mystical grove where she tends to the spiritual essence of all plant life in Gensokyo. She rarely leaves her domain, but recent incidents have drawn her into the broader world of Gensokyo's supernatural conflicts.

## Powers and Abilities

### Primary Ability: "Manipulation of the Essence of Decay"
The power to control the concept of decay itself - not just making things rot, but controlling the entire process of breakdown, transformation, and the beauty found within deterioration. She can accelerate, reverse, or suspend the natural decay cycle of any organic matter.

**Core Applications:**
- **Decay Acceleration:** Ages objects instantly (fresh leaf → withered → dust)
- **Decay Reversal:** Restores things to previous states (ash → dead leaf → fresh leaf)  
- **Decay Suspension:** Freezes things at their most beautiful moment of deterioration
- **Selective Decay:** Can decay specific parts while preserving others
- **Conceptual Decay:** Can apply decay to abstract things (memories fade, magic weakens, emotions wither)

### Secondary Applications:
- **Temporal Perception:** Sees the "decay timeline" of everything around her
- **Essence Preservation:** Maintains the spiritual essence of things even as they physically decay
- **Beauty in Endings:** Finds and enhances the aesthetic peak moment during any decay process
- **Cycle Mastery:** Understands that all decay leads to new growth

### Combat Style:
- **Decay State Control:** Uses different stages of decay as tactical options
  - Fresh state: Full power, predictable patterns
  - Withering state: Unpredictable, changes mid-attack  
  - Dead state: Passes through some defenses, lingers longer
  - Beyond death: Becomes conceptual, affects non-physical things

- **Temporal Battlefield:** Manipulates the decay timeline
  - Creates "decay zones" where everything ages rapidly
  - "Preservation bubbles" where nothing can deteriorate
  - Overlaps multiple decay states in the same space

- **Conceptual Attacks:** Applies decay beyond physical matter
  - Can make opponent's spell cards "wither" and lose power
  - Causes magical barriers to "age" and weaken
  - Makes memories of attack patterns fade, forcing opponents to relearn mid-fight

- **Aesthetic Combat:** Finds the most beautiful moment in any destruction
  - Her attacks are most dangerous when they look most beautiful
  - Can make opponents hesitate by creating stunning decay patterns
  - Victory through overwhelming beauty rather than overwhelming force

### Last Word:

  - *Pattern:* Reality itself decays around the player - spell card rules, bullet patterns, even the concept of "winning" begins to wither, leaving only pure aesthetic experience
  - *Ability Use:* Ultimate conceptual decay - breaks down the very framework of the battle while preserving only beauty
